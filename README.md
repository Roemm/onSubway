# On the Subway
On the subway presents the sound in the Shanghai metro. By clicking on different characters, the user can hear the sound the corresponding person generates. This project tries to create an immersive experience that allows the user to see the metro picture by hearing sounds.


All the drawings here are from a Chinese painter 黄沛. She created a serial of drawings</a> which portrays all kind of people she met on the Chongqing metro. Inspired by her work, I decided to portray the metro in a different way--sound. The conversations I recoded are just casual chats about their normal life.
